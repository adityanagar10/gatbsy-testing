Mars Hackathon Launched in India to Empower Developers With Robust Decentralized Storage Solutions



The Web3 wave in India has attracted global attention and the Indian developer community has proven its competency by solving relevant real-world issues through accessible solutions. The overall Indian public cloud services market is likely to touch $7.4 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 22.2% for 2020-24.

With its first India-focused hackathon, the Mars Hackathon 2021, Filecoin aims to strengthen the community further and pave the path towards more creation and innovation within decentralized storage technologies. It will be focused on providing the right tools to the robust developer ecosystem of India and helping them in creating and improving their innovations.

This eight-week hackathon is open to beginners as well as experienced coders and is a platform for developers to explore the world of decentralized storage. Participants can learn by creating new or enhancing existing dApps that solve everyday decentralized storage problems on FIlecoin or IPFS networks or by building on Polygon while exploring the utility of Filecoin and IPFS for their storage requirements. Starting from September 7, 2021, this unique hackathon is aimed at revolutionizing the world of storage in Asia.

Grants and prizes worth $500K are available to the teams, startups, projects, and entrepreneurs choosing to continue their journey of building on the Filecoin and IPFS stacks. Beyond hackathons, together with the collaborators and partners of the FIlecoin and IPFS ecosystem, participants stand to gain networking opportunities that will open various platforms for their ideas to grow into winning ventures.

"We are looking forward to witnessing the new and innovative solutions that will come through during the Mars Hackathon. The growth of the Indian developer ecosystem in the decentralized space has been highly impressive till now and we are delighted to have the opportunity to see it in real-time. Through Mars Hackathon, we hope to encourage and empower developers and entrepreneurs to solve significant problems, ship innovative applications and shape the future of the web to be more decentralized, robust, and secure. Asia is a budding technology ecosystem and blockchain technology has brought certain regions of Asia to the forefront globally. We hope to be a part of this growing ecosystem through Filecoin, our decentralized storage solution and help in fixing the pitfalls of the current centralized cloud infrastructure.” mentioned Angie Maguire - Head Of Growth and Marketing, Filecoin
